A prototype that uses video footage to distinguish a real person from attempts to imitate a real person (for example, by filming a
photo). This was realized using the Eulerian Video Magnification Algorithm and deep
learning. The prototype was implemented in Matlab and Python using the PyTorch
framework. The Eulerian Video Magnification Algorithm is able to visualize color changes
of the skin caused by the heartbeat. The resulting data was then classified using a deep
learning algorithm. In the evaluation of the prototype, a hit rate of around 80% was achieved.
The unexpected occurrence of color variations in filmed photos prevented a higher hit rate.
